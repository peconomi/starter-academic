abstract: "The containerized shipping market operates like a bus system with vessels
assigned to round trip transport services between origin-destination pairs.
Transport operators must commit to sufficient shipping capacity, while ac-
counting for possible bilateral shipping imbalances. To ensure necessary trans-
port equipment availability, vessel owners must redistribute empty container
units on the low-volume leg of a round trip, back from import-oriented origin
locations to export-oriented destinations. I provide evidence of US container
traffic being consistently balanced when accounting for empty container unit
flows. I also document a positive relationship between the US trade deficit
and the scale of the empty container redistribution problem. Motivated by
the US recently passing the Ocean Shipping Reform Act of 2022, I explore the
effects of a restriction to empty container outflows in favor of stimulating US
exports. This form of intervention backfires, leading to elevated import prices,
contractions in transport capacity, and reduced trade activity. Upon account-
ing for differences in countriesâ€™ extensive and intensive margins of reliance
on empty container returns, I find evidence to suggest that these backfiring
effects on opposite-leg routes intensify."

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: __Job Market Paper [Latest Version]__ <br /> Using novel container traffic data at the port level, I document the empty container redistribution and nationally balanced exchange of container units between the US and Rest of the World. Upon preparing a partial equilibrium model of round trip trade, I calibrate and estimate a multi-country baseline scenario of US containerized trade and consider the effect of government intervention in which empty container use is restricted in order to stimulate US export activity. I find that policy backfires, resulting in a reduction in allocated shipping capacity, import price inflation and an overall decline in trade activity on net exporter round trip routes. For routes which exhibit a greater reliance on empty container returns, I find that these backfiring effects are greater in magnitude.
