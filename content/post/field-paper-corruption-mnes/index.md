Using the World Bank Enterprise Surveys and an augmented proximity-concentration model based on the Helpman et al. (2004) framework, I test whether host country corruption influences the composition of local exporters and multinational enterprise (MNE) affiliates.
In this setting, a firm's 'type' is assumed to be determined by an exogenously drawn productivity level and country-specific fixed costs.
I find evidence that greater degrees of host corruption cause underling fixed costs to rise, reflected by differences in average firm producitivty, both at the country and country-industry levels.
In particular, local corruption contributes to increased exporter fixed costs for both domestic firms and MNEs, costs which only relatively more productive firms can afford.
A one unit intensification of corruption is associated with 2.53 to 4.81 percent and 1.41 to 2.53 percent higher average productivity across reamining exporting MNE affiliates and domestically-owned firms, respectively, relative to domestically-owned non-exporters.
These findings suggest that corruption is a deteriment to export participation and limit participation to a subset of relatively more productive firms that can afford the associated costs.
