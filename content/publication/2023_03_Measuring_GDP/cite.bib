abstract = {In 2015, changes to Irish tax legislation coincided with a 26% annual increase in real gross domestic product, driven by the presence of multinational enterprises (MNEs). We provide a method of statistically isolating variation in GDP growth attributable solely to domestic activity. Our findings imply a 21% lower level of GDP relative to the official measure recorded for 2020. We recommend our methodology to policymakers in economies where profit-shifting MNE activities introduce challenges to business cycle and fiscal monitoring.}
