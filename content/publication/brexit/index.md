abstract: This Article attempts to quantify the macroeconomic impact of Brexit
  on the Irish economy. Given both the political and economic uncertainty, we
  consider a range of alternative scenarios. We focus on the most well
  understood channels through which Brexit will affect Ireland, namely though
  lower trade, incorporating the impact of tariff and non-tariff measures, and
  the potentially positive impact of FDI diversion to Ireland. Our approach, and
  the main contribution of this paper, is to build up estimates of each of these
  channels from a range of recent microeconomic studies, so our estimates are
  anchored in the empirical literature. We then use these micro-estimates to
  calibrate macro scenarios; specifically we generate alternative paths for the
  UK and international economy using the NiGEM global model and assess the
  impact on Ireland using the COSMO model. Overall, in each scenario, the level
  of Irish output is permanently below where it otherwise would have been were
  the UK to decide to remain in the EU.
