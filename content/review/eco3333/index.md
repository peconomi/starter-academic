<details>
Exchange across international boundaries, theory of comparative advantage, balance of payments and adjustments, international financial movements, exchange rates and international financial institutions, trade restrictions and policy. I split this course into three components: (i) Trade Theory - using the older models to highlight the gains from trade and potential ambiguity of labor market outcomes, (ii) Trade Policy - shifts us away from extremes of autarky and free trade to varying degrees of trade openness through tariff rate adjustments and import quotas, and (iii) Global Finance - provides a broad understanding of exchange rate movements and associated monetary policy.
