<details>
Application of classical statistical techniques of estimation, hypothesis testing, and regression to economic models. Includes laboratory section in Social Science Instructional Laboratory which teaches students how to code in R and prepare basic econometric analyses.
Provided direct `R` lessons on a weekly basis. 
I have since handed these lessons on to other teaching assistants in an effort to streamline the process.
