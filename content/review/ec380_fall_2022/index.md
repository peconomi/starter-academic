<details>
Exchange across international boundaries, theory of comparative advantage, balance of payments and adjustments, international financial movements, exchange rates and international financial institutions, trade restrictions and policy. I split this course into three components: (i) Trade Theory - using the older models to highlight the gains from trade and potential ambiguity of labor market outcomes, (ii) Trade Policy - shifts us away from extremes of autarky and free trade to varying degrees of trade openness through tariff rate adjustments and import quotas, and (iii) Global Finance - provides a broad understanding of exchange rate movements and associated monetary policy. The Balance of Payments acts as our set of indicators for the state of the economy.

Using the modules section on Canvas to also show what we were reviewing for the week and also link the recordings would also have helped a lot. He did start to do it later in the course."

      "text": "Professor Economides was really helpful and I'm so grateful he was able to meet me outside his normal office hours. It really helped to meet in office hours and ask all my questions. It was also nice to learn more about Brexit and the actual affects it can have on the world economy, as I don't think people really know how crazy the entire situation is."
