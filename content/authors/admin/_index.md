I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at the University of Oregon and a citizen of the Republic of Ireland. 
My research focuses on maritime trade and transport, and addresses liner shipping regulation, port congestion and environmental policy. 
Leveraging tools from both reduced-form empirics and structural analyses, I explore complex models of transport logistics and assess recently implemented maritime policy. 
As a secondary area of interest, I also pursue studies on multinational enterprise activities and have recently published a study of the influence of MNE's intellectual property on Irish GDP in Economics Letters.
Prior to my time in Oregon, I was engaged in policy research as macroeconomic RA at the Economic and Social Research Institute in Ireland.
