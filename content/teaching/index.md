           <summary>1. Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) 70</summary>
           <p></br>On October 2016, the IMO approved a roadmap for developing a comprehensive IMO strategy on reduction of GHG emissions from ships, which includes a three-step approach consisting in: 1) collecting data on ships' fuel oil consumption, 2) analysing this data and 3) make decision on what further measures to enhance the energy efficiency shipping, if any, are required. Starting from __1 January 2019__, ships of 5,000 GT and above (representing approximately 85% of the total CO2 emissions from international shipping) are required to collect consumption data for each type of fuel oil they use, as well as, additionally, other specified data, including proxies for "transport work".

The Secretariat is required to produce an annual report to the MEPC, summarizing the data collected. The first IMO report analysing and summarizing the data collected in 2019 will be presented at MEPC 77, in __Spring 2021__.</p>
