Following the midterm course evaluation, he made changes which positively impacted the class based on student suggestions. His willingness to listen to students and hear our concerns was beneficial, and I feel that it was a strength of his (along with individual support in course material)."

      "title": "Review 8",
      "text": "Lectures are taught too fast to write notes. Instructions for assignments are hard to interpret. Communication needs to be better with the lab assistant on teaching R."
    },
  {
      "title": "Review 9",
      "text": "I have experienced a lot of accessibility problems in terms of technology with the course."
    },
   {
      "title": "Review 10",
      "text": "I've never had an instructor before who coupled so well being incredibly kind and accessible and supportive with also challenging me to constantly keep working to improve--whether it's a better data cleaning strategy or piece of code or conceptual understanding (even if Mas-Colell is still beyond me). I learned more in this class than any other class that I've taken, all due to a combination of immense patience and high standards, which combined to both demand and facilitate high-quality work."
